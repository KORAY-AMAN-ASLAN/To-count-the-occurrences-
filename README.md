# Word Frequency Counter

This repository contains a C++ program that counts the frequency of each word in a text file and displays the most frequent words. The program is case-insensitive and sorts words based on their occurrence.

## Overview

The program reads a specified text file, counts how often each word appears in the file, and then displays the `n` most frequent words, with `n` being a user-specified number. It uses C++ Standard Library containers and algorithms for efficient data handling and sorting.

### Key Features

- Case-insensitive word counting.
- Sorting words by frequency.
- Displaying the top `n` frequent words in a formatted table.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have a C++ compiler installed.
3. Compile the program using a command like `g++ -o wordcounter wordcounter.cpp`.
4. Run the program and enter the path to your text file when prompted.
5. Specify the number of top frequent words you want to see.

## Requirements

- A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang).
- A text file for analyzing word frequency.

## Contributing

Contributions, ideas, and bug reports are welcome. Feel free to fork, modify, and make pull requests or open issues to improve the program.
